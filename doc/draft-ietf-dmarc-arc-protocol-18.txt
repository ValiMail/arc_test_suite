              Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) Protocol
                    draft-ietf-dmarc-arc-protocol-18

Abstract

   The Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) protocol provides an
   authenticated "chain of custody" for a message, allowing each entity
   that handles the message to see what entities handled it before, and
   to see what the message's authentication assessment was at each step
   in the handling.

   ARC allows Internet Mail Handlers to attach assertions of message
   authentication assessment to individual messages.  As messages
   traverse ARC-enabled Internet Mail Handlers, additional ARC
   assertions can be attached to messages to form ordered sets of ARC
   assertions that represent the authentication assessment at each step
   of message handling paths.

   ARC-enabled Internet Mail Handlers can process sets of ARC assertions
   to inform message disposition decisions, to identify Internet Mail
   Handlers that might break existing authentication mechanisms, and to
   convey original authentication assessments across trust boundaries.

1.  Introduction

   The utility of widely deployed email authentication technologies such
   as Sender Policy Framework (SPF) [RFC7208] and DomainKeys Identified
   Mail (DKIM) [RFC6376] is impacted by the processing of Internet Mail
   by intermediate handlers.  This impact is thoroughly documented in
   the defining documents for SPF and DKIM and further discussed in
   [RFC6377] and [RFC7960].

   DMARC [RFC7489] also relies upon SPF and DKIM authentication
   mechanisms.  Failures of authentication caused by the actions of
   intermediate handlers can cause legitimate mail to be incorrectly
   rejected or misdirected.

   Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) creates a mechanism for individual
   Internet Mail Handlers to add their authentication assessment to a
   message's ordered set of handling results.  ARC encapsulates the
   authentication assessment in a DKIM signature derivative to grant
   other handlers the ability to verify the authenticity of the
   individual assessment assertion as well as the aggregate set and
   sequence of results.

   Ordered sets of authentication assessments can be used by ARC-enabled
   Internet Mail Handlers to inform message handling disposition, to
   identify where alteration of message content might have occurred, and
   to provide additional trace information for use in understanding
   message handling paths.

2.  General Concepts

   ARC is loosely based on concepts from evidence collection.  Evidence
   is usually collected, labeled, stored, and transported in specific
   ways to preserve the state of evidence and to document all processing
   steps.

2.1.  Evidence

   In ARC's situation, the "evidence" is a message's authentication
   assessment at any point along the delivery path between origination
   and final delivery.  Determination of message authentication can be
   affected when intermediate handlers modify message content (header
   fields and/or body content), route messages through unforeseen paths,
   or change envelope information.

   The authentication assessment for a message is determined upon
   receipt of a message and documented in the Authentication-Results
   header field(s).  ARC extends this mechanism to survive transit
   through intermediary ADMDs.

   Because the first-hand determination of an authentication assessment
   can never be reproduced by other handlers, the assertion of the
   authentication assessment is more akin to testimony by a verifiable
   party than hard evidence which can be independently evaluated.

2.2.  Custody

   "Custody" refers to when an Internet Mail Handler processes a
   message.  When a handler takes custody of a message, the handler
   becomes a custodian and attaches their own evidence (authentication
   assessment upon receipt) to the message if they are ARC-enabled.
   Evidence is added in such a way so that future handlers can verify
   the authenticity of both evidence and custody.

2.3.  Chain of Custody

   The "chain of custody" of ARC is the entire set of evidence and
   custody that travels with a message.

2.4.  Validation of Chain of Custody

   Any ARC-enabled Internet Mail Handler can validate the entire set of
   custody and the authentication assessments asserted by each party to
   yield a valid Chain of Custody.  If the evidence-supplying custodians
   can be trusted, then the validated Chain of Custody describes the
   (possibly changing) authentication assessment as the message traveled
   through various custodians.



Andersen, et al.          Expires April 5, 2019                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                ARC-Protocol                  October 2018


   Even though a message's authentication assessment might have changed,
   the validated chain of custody can be used to determine if the
   changes (and the custodians responsible for the changes) can be
   tolerated.

3.  Terminology and Definitions

   This section defines terms used in the rest of the document.

   Readers should to be familiar with the contents, core concepts, and
   definitions found in [RFC5598].  The potential roles of transit
   services in the delivery of email are directly relevant.

   Language, syntax (including some ABNF constructs), and concepts are
   imported from DKIM [RFC6376].  Specific references to DKIM are made
   throughout this document.  The following terms are imported from
   [RFC5598]:

   o  ADministrative Management Domain (ADMD), Section 2.3

   o  Message Transfer Agents (MTA), Section 4.3.2

   o  Message Submission Agent (MSA), Section 4.3.1

   o  Message Delivery Agent (MDA), Section 4.3.3

   Syntax descriptions use Augmented BNF (ABNF) [RFC5234] and [RFC7405].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.  These words may also appear in this
   document in lower case as plain English words, absent their normative
   meanings.

3.1.  ARC Set

   Section 4.1 introduces three (3) ARC header fields which are added to
   a message by an ARC-enabled internet mail handler.  Together, these
   three header fields compose a single "ARC Set".  An ARC Set provides
   the means for an Internet Mail Handler to attach an authentication
   assessment to a message in a manner that can be verified by future
   handlers.  A single message can contain multiple ARC Sets.

   In general concept terms, an ARC Set represents Evidence and Custody.

Internet-Draft                ARC-Protocol                  October 2018


3.2.  Authenticated Received Chain (ARC)

   The sequence of ARC Sets attached to a message at a given time is
   called the Authenticated Received Chain.  An Authenticated Received
   Chain is the record of individual authentication assessments as a
   message traverses through ARC-participating ADMDs.

   The first attachment of an ARC Set to a message causes an
   Authenticated Received Chain to be created.  Additional attachments
   of ARC Sets cause the Authenticated Received Chain to be extended.

   In General concept terms, an Authenticated Received Chain represents
   Chain of Custody.

3.3.  Internet Mail Handlers / Intermediaries

   Internet Mail Handlers process and deliver messages across the
   Internet and include MSAs, MTAs, MDAs, gateways, and mailing lists as
   defined in [RFC5598].

   Throughout this document the term "intermediaries" refers to the both
   regular MTAs as well as delivery/reposting agents such as mailing
   lists covered within the scope of [RFC5598]'s transit services.

   "Intermediaries" and "Internet Mail Handlers" are used synonymously
   throughout this document.

3.4.  Authentication Assessment

   The Authentication Assessment which is affixed to a message as part
   of each ARC Set consists of the "authres-payload" [I-D-7601bis].  For
   the integrity of an ARC Set, the Authentication Assessment only needs
   to be properly encapsulated within the ARC Set as defined below
   Section 4.1.  The accuracy or syntax of the authres-payload field
   does not affect the validity of the ARC chain itself.

3.5.  Signing vs Sealing

   Signing is the process of affixing a digital signature to a message
   as a header field, such as when a DKIM-Signature (as in [RFC6376]
   section 2.1), or an AMS or AS is added.  Sealing is when an ADMD
   affixes a complete and valid ARC Set to a message creating or
   continuing an Authenticated Received Chain.

Internet-Draft                ARC-Protocol                  October 2018


3.6.  Sealer

   A Sealer is an Internet Mail Handler that attaches a complete and
   valid ARC Set to a message.

   In general concept terms, a Sealer adds its testimony (assertion of
   authentication assessment) and proof of custody to the Chain of
   Custody.

3.7.  Validator

   A Validator is an ARC-enabled Internet Mail Handler that evaluates an
   Authenticated Received Chain for validity and content.  The process
   of evaluation of the individual ARC Sets that compose an
   Authenticated Received Chain is described in Section 5.2.

   In general concept terms, a Validator inspects the Chain of Custody
   to determine the content and validity of individual Evidence supplied
   by custodians.

3.8.  Imported ABNF Tokens

   The following ABNF tokens are imported:

   o  tag-list ([RFC6376] section 3.2)

   o  authres-payload ([I-D-7601bis] section 2.2)

   o  cfws ([RFC5322] section 3.2.2)

3.9.  Common ABNF Tokens

   The following ABNF tokens are used elsewhere in this document:

   position     = 1*2DIGIT                         ; 1 - 50
   instance     = [CFWS] %s"i" [CFWS] "="
                  [CFWS] position
   chain-status = ("none" / "fail" / "pass")
   seal-cv-tag  = %s"cv" [CFWS] "="
                  [CFWS] chain-status

4.  Protocol Elements

4.1.  ARC Header Fields

   ARC introduces three new header fields.  Syntax for new header fields
   adapts existing specifications.  This document only describes where

Internet-Draft                ARC-Protocol                  October 2018


   ARC-specific changes in syntax and semantics differ from existing
   specifications.

4.1.1.  ARC-Authentication-Results (AAR)

   The ARC-Authentication-Results (AAR) header field records the message
   authentication assessment as processed by an ARC-participating ADMD
   at message arrival time.

   In general concept terms, the AAR header field is where Evidence is
   recorded by a custodian.

   The AAR header field is similar in syntax and semantics to an
   Authentication-Results field [I-D-7601bis], with two (2) differences:

   o  the name of the header field itself;

   o  the presence of the "instance tag".  Additional information on the
      "instance tag" can be found in Section 4.2.1.

   The formal ABNF for the AAR header field is:

   arc-info = instance [CFWS] ";" authres-payload
   arc-authres-header = "ARC-Authentication-Results:" [CFWS] arc-info

   Because there is only one AAR allowed per ARC set, the AAR MUST
   contain the combined authres-payload with all of the authentication
   results from within the participating ADMD, regardless of how many
   Authentication-Results header fields are attached to the message.

4.1.2.  ARC-Message-Signature (AMS)

   The ARC-Message-Signature (AMS) header field allows an ARC-
   participating ADMD to convey some responsibility (custodianship) for
   a message and possible message modifications to future ARC-
   participating custodians.

   In general concept terms, the AMS header field identifies a
   custodian.

   The AMS header field has the same syntax and semantics as the DKIM-
   Signature field [RFC6376], with three (3) differences:

   o  the name of the header field itself;

   o  no version tag ("v") is defined for the AMS header field.  As
      required for undefined tags (in [RFC6376]), if seen, a version tag
      MUST be ignored;

Internet-Draft                ARC-Protocol                  October 2018


   o  the "i" (AUID) tag is not imported from DKIM; instead, this tag is
      replaced by the "instance tag" as defined in Section 4.2.1;

   ARC places no requirements on the selectors and/or domains used for
   the AMS header field signatures.

   The formal ABNF for the AMS header field is:

   arc-ams-info = instance [CFWS] ";" tag-list
   arc-message-signature = "ARC-Message-Signature:" [CFWS] arc-ams-info

   To reduce the chances of accidental invalidation of AMS signatures:

   o  AMS header fields are added by ARC-participating ADMDs as messages
      exit the ADMD.  AMS header fields SHOULD be attached so that any
      modifications made by the ADMD are included in the signature of
      the AMS header field.

   o  Authentication-Results header fields MUST NOT be included in AMS
      signatures as they are likely to be deleted by downstream ADMDs
      (per [I-D-7601bis] Section 5).

   o  ARC-related header fields (ARC-Authentication-Results, ARC-
      Message-Signature, ARC-Seal) MUST NOT be included in the list of
      header fields covered by the signature of the AMS header field.

   To preserve the ability to verify the integrity of a message, the
   signature of the AMS header field SHOULD include any DKIM-Signature
   header fields already present in the message.

4.1.3.  ARC-Seal (AS)

   The ARC-Seal (AS) header field permits ARC-participating ADMDs to
   verify the integrity of AAR header fields and corresponding AMS
   header fields.

   In general concept terms, the AS header field is how custodians bind
   their authentication assessments (testimonial) into a Chain of
   Custody so that Validators can inspect individual evidence and
   custodians.

   The AS header field is similar in syntax and semantics to DKIM-
   Signatures [RFC6376], with the following differences:

   o  the "i" (AUID) tag is not imported from DKIM; instead, this tag is
      replaced by the "instance tag" as defined in Section 4.2.1;

Internet-Draft                ARC-Protocol                  October 2018


   o  the signature of the AS header field does not cover the body of
      the message and therefore there is no 'bh' tag.  The signature of
      the AS header field only covers specific header fields as defined
      in Section 5.1.1;

   o  no body canonicalization is performed as the AS signature does not
      cover the body of a message;

   o  only "relaxed" header field canonicalization ([RFC6376] section
      3.4.2) is used;

   o  the only supported tags are "i" (from Section 4.2.1 of this
      document), and "a", "b", "d, "s", "t" from [RFC6376] Section 3.5.
      Note especially that the DKIM "h" tag is NOT allowed and if found,
      MUST result in a cv status of "fail" (for more information see
      Section 5.1.1);

   o  an additional tag, "cv" ("seal-cv-tag" in the ARC-Seal ABNF
      definition) is used to communicate Chain Validation Status to
      subsequent ADMDs.

   ARC places no requirements on the selectors and/or domains used for
   the AS header field signatures.

   The formal ABNF for the AS header field is:

   arc-as-info = instance [CFWS] ";" tag-list
   arc-seal = "ARC-Seal:" [CFWS] arc-as-info

4.1.4.  Internationalized Email (EAI)

   In internationalized messages [RFC6532] many header fields can
   contain UTF-8 as well as ASCII text.  The changes for EAI are all
   inherited from DKIM as updated by [draft-levine-eaiauth] and
   Authentication-Results as updated in [I-D-7601bis], but are called
   out here for emphasis.

   In all ARC header fields, the d= s= tags can contain U-labels.  In
   all tags, non-ASCII characters need not be quoted in dkim-quoted-
   printable.

   The AAR header allows UTF-8 in the same places that A-R does, as
   described in [I-D-7601bis].

4.2.  ARC Set

   An "ARC Set" is a single collection of three ARC header fields (AAR,
   AMS, and AS).  ARC header fields of an ARC Set share the same
   "instance" value.

   By adding all ARC header fields to a message, an ARC Sealer adds an
   ARC Set to a message.  A description of how Sealers add an ARC Set to
   a message is found in Section 5.1.

4.2.1.  Instance Tags

   Instance tags describe which ARC header fields belong to an ARC Set.
   Each ARC header field of an ARC Set shares the same instance tag
   value.

   Instance tag values are integers that begin at 1 and are incremented
   by each addition of an ARC Set. Through the incremental values of
   instance tags, an ARC Validator can determine the order in which ARC
   Sets were added to a message.

   Instance tag values can range from 1-50 (inclusive).

   _INFORMATIONAL:_ The upper limit of 50 was picked based on some
   initial observations reported by early working group members.  The
   value was chosen so as to balance the risk of excessive header field
   growth Section 9.1 against expert opinion regarding the probability
   of long-tail but non-looping multiple-intermediary mail flows.
   Longer ARC chains will also impose load on validators and DNS to
   support additional verification steps.  Observed quantities of
   "Received" header fields was also considered in establishing this as
   an experimental initial value.

   Valid ARC Sets MUST have exactly one instance of each ARC header
   field (AAR, AMS, and AS) for a given instance value and signing
   algorithm.

   For handling multiple signing algorithms, see [ARC-MULTI].

4.3.  Authenticated Received Chain

   An Authenticated Received Chain is an ordered collection of ARC Sets.
   As ARC Sets are enumerated sets of ARC header fields, an
   Authenticated Received Chain represents the output of message
   authentication assessments along the handling path of ARC-enabled
   processors.





Andersen, et al.          Expires April 5, 2019                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                ARC-Protocol                  October 2018


   Authentication Assessments determined at each step of the ARC-enabled
   handling path is present in an Authenticated Received Chain in the
   form of AAR header fields.  The ability to verify the identity of
   message handlers and the integrity of message content is provided by
   AMS header fields.  AS header fields allow messages handlers to
   validate the assertions, order and sequence of the Authenticated
   Received Chain itself.

   In general concept terms, an Authenticated Received Chain represents
   a message's Chain of Custody.  Validators can consult a message's
   Chain of Custody to gain insight regarding each custodian of a
   message and the Evidence collected by each custodian.

4.4.  Chain Validation Status

   The state of the Authenticated Received Chain at a specific
   processing step is called the "Chain Validation Status".  Chain
   Validation Status information is communicated in several ways:

   o  the AS header field in the "cv" tag, and

   o  as part of Authentication-Results and AAR header field(s).

   Chain Validation Status has one of three possible values:

   o  none: There was no Authenticated Received Chain on the message
      when it arrived for validation.  Typically, this occurs when a
      message is received directly from a message's original Message
      Transfer Agent (MTA) or Message Submission Agent (MSA), or from an
      upstream Internet Mail Handler that is not participating in ARC
      handling.

   o  fail: The message contains an Authenticated Received Chain whose
      validation failed.

   o  pass: The message contains an Authenticated Received Chain whose
      validation succeeded.

5.  Protocol Actions

   ARC-enabled Internet Mail Handlers generally act as both ARC
   Validators (when receiving messages) and ARC Sealers (when sending
   messages onward, not originated locally).

   An Authenticated Received Chain with a Chain Validation Status of
   "pass" (or "none") allows Internet Mail Handlers to ascertain:





Andersen, et al.          Expires April 5, 2019                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                ARC-Protocol                  October 2018


   o  all ARC-participating ADMDs that claim responsibility for handling
      (and possibly modifying) the message in transit;

   o  the authentication assessments of the message as determined by
      each ADMD (from AAR header fields).

   With this information, Internet Mail Handlers MAY inform local policy
   decisions regarding disposition of messages that experience
   authentication failure due to intermediate processing.

5.1.  Sealer Actions

   To "seal" a message, an ARC Sealer adds an ARC Set (the three ARC
   header fields AAR, AMS, and AS) to a message.  All ARC header fields
   in an ARC Set share the same instance tag value.

   To perform Sealing (aka to build and attach a new ARC Set), the
   following actions must be taken by an ARC Sealer when presented with
   a message:

   1.  All message modifications (including adding DKIM-Signature header
       field(s)) MUST be performed before Sealing.

   2.  If the message already contains an Authenticated Received Chain
       with the most recent AS reporting "cv=fail", then there is no
       need to proceed and the algorithm stops here.

   3.  Calculate the instance value: if the message already contains an
       Authenticated Received Chain, the instance value is 1 more than
       the highest instance number found in the Authenticated Received
       Chain.  If no Authenticated Received Chain exists, the instance
       value is 1.

   4.  Using the calculated instance value, generate and attach a
       complete ARC set to the message as follows:

       1.  Generate and attach an ARC-Authentication-Results header
           field as defined in Section 4.1.1.

       2.  Generate and attach an ARC-Message-Signature header field as
           defined in Section 4.1.2.

       3.  Generate and attach an ARC-Seal header field using the AS
           definition found in Section 4.1.3, the prescribed headers
           defined in Section 5.1.1, and the Chain Validation Status as
           determined during ARC Validation.

5.1.1.  Header Fields To Include In ARC-Seal Signatures

   The ARC-Seal is generated in a manner similar to how DKIM-Signatures
   are added to messages ([RFC6376], section 3.7), with explicit
   requirements on the header fields and ordering of those fields.

   The signature of an AS header field signs a canonicalized form of the
   ARC Set header field values.  The ARC set header field values are
   supplied to the hash function in increasing instance order, starting
   at 1, and include the ARC Set being added at the time of Sealing the
   message.

   Within an ARC Set, header fields are supplied to the hash function in
   the following order:

   1.  ARC-Authentication-Results

   2.  ARC-Message-Signature

   3.  ARC-Seal

   Note that when an Authenticated Received Chain has failed validation,
   the signing scope for the ARC-Seal is modified as specified in
   Section 5.1.2.

5.1.2.  Marking and Sealing "cv=fail" (Invalid) Chains

   In the case of a failed Authenticated Received Chain, the header
   fields included in the signature scope of the AS header field b=
   value MUST only include the ARC Set header fields created by the MTA
   which detected the malformed chain, as if this newest ARC Set was the
   only set present.

   _INFORMATIONAL_: This approach is mandated to handle the case of a
   malformed or otherwise invalid Authenticated Received Chain.  There
   is no way to generate a deterministic set of AS header fields
   (Section 5.1.1) in most cases of invalid chains.

5.1.3.  Only One Authenticated Received Chain Per Message

   A message can have only one Authenticated Received Chain on it at a
   time.  Once broken, the chain cannot be continued, as the chain of
   custody is no longer valid and responsibility for the message has
   been lost.  For further discussion of this topic and the design
   restriction which prevents chain continuation or re-establishment,
   see [ARC-USAGE].

Internet-Draft                ARC-Protocol                  October 2018


5.1.4.  Broad Ability to Seal

   ARC is not solely intended for perimeter MTAs.  Any Internet Mail
   Handler MAY seal a message by adding a complete ARC set, whether or
   not they have modified or are aware of having modified the message.
   For additional information, see Section 7.1.

5.1.5.  Sealing is Always Safe

   The utility of an Authenticated Received Chain is limited to very
   specific cases.  Authenticated Received Chains are designed to
   provide additional information to an Internet Mail Handler when
   evaluating messages for delivery in the context of authentication
   failures.  Specifically:

   o  Properly adding an ARC Set to a message does not damage or
      invalidate an existing Authenticated Received Chain.

   o  Sealing an Authenticated Received Chain when a message has not
      been modified does not negatively affect the chain.

   o  Validating a message exposes no new threat vectors (see
      Section 9).

   o  An ADMD may choose to Seal all inbound messages whether or not a
      message has been modified or will be retransmitted.

5.2.  Validator Actions

   A validator performs the following steps, in sequence, to process an
   Authenticated Received Chain.  Canonicalization, hash functions, and
   signature validation methods are imported from [RFC6376] section 5.

   1.  Collect all ARC Sets currently attached to the message.

       *  If there are none, the Chain Validation Status is "none" and
          the algorithm stops here.

       *  The maximum number of ARC Sets that can be attached to a
          message is 50.  If more than the maximum number exist the
          Chain Validation Status is "fail" and the algorithm stops
          here.

       *  In the following algorithm, the maximum discovered ARC
          instance value is referred to as "N".






Andersen, et al.          Expires April 5, 2019                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                ARC-Protocol                  October 2018


   2.  If the Chain Validation Status of the highest instance value ARC
       Set is "fail", then the Chain Validation status is "fail" and the
       algorithm stops here.

   3.  Validate the structure of the Authenticated Received Chain.  A
       valid ARC has the following conditions:

       1.  Each ARC Set MUST contain exactly one each of the three ARC
           header fields (AAR, AMS, and AS).

       2.  The instance values of the ARC Sets MUST form a continuous
           sequence from 1..N with no gaps or repetition.

       3.  The "cv" value for all ARC-Seal header fields MUST NOT be
           "fail".  For ARC Sets with instance values > 1, the values
           MUST be "pass".  For the ARC Set with instance value = 1, the
           value MUST be "none".

       *  If any of these conditions are not met, the Chain Validation
          Status is "fail" and the algorithm stops here.

   4.  Validate the AMS with the greatest instance value (most recent).
       If validation fails, then the Chain Validation Status is "fail"
       and the algorithm stops here.

   5.  _OPTIONAL:_ Determine the "oldest-pass" value from the ARC Set by
       validating each prior AMS beginning with the N-1 and proceeding
       in decreasing order to the AMS with the instance value of 1:

       1.  If an AMS fails to validate (for instance value "M"), then
           set the oldest-pass value to the lowest AMS instance value
           which passed (M+1) and go to the next step (there is no need
           to check any other (older) AMS header fields).  This does not
           affect the validity of the Authenticated Received Chain.

       2.  If all AMS header fields verify, set the oldest-pass value to
           zero (0).

   6.  Validate each AS beginning with the greatest instance value and
       proceeding in decreasing order to the AS with the instance value
       of 1.  If any AS fails to validate, the Chain Validation Status
       is "fail" and the algorithm stops here.

   7.  If the algorithm reaches this step, then the Chain Validation
       Status is "pass", and the algorithm is complete.

   The end result of this Validation algorithm SHOULD be included within
   the Authentication-Results header field for the ADMD.

Internet-Draft                ARC-Protocol                  October 2018


   As with a DKIM signature ([RFC6376] section 6.3) which fails
   verification, a message with an Authenticated Received Chain with a
   Chain Validation status of "fail" MUST be treated the same as a
   message with no Authenticated Received Chain.

   _INFORMATIONAL_: Recipients of an invalid or failing Authenticated
   Received Chain can use that information as part of a wider handling
   context.  ARC adoption cannot be assumed by intermediaries; many
   intermediaries will continue to modify messages without adding ARC
   Seals.

5.2.1.  All Failures Are Permanent

   Authenticated Received Chains represent the traversal of messages
   through one or more intermediaries.  All errors, including DNS
   failures, become unrecoverable and are considered permanent.

   Any error validating an Authenticated Received Chain results in a
   Chain Validation Status of "fail".  For further discussion of this
   topic and the design restriction which prevents chain continuation or
   re-establishment, see [ARC-USAGE].

5.2.2.  Responding to ARC Validation Failures During the SMTP
        Transaction

   If an ARC Validator determines that the incoming message fails
   authentication checks (potentially including ARC validation), the
   Validator MAY signal the breakage through the extended SMTP response
   code 5.7.29 "ARC validation failure" and corresponding SMTP basic
   response code.  Validators MAY use the more general 5.7.28 "Multiple
   authentication checks failed" instead.

6.  Communication of Validation Results

   Chain Validation Status (described in Section 4.4) is communicated
   via Authentication-Results (and AAR) header fields using the auth
   method "arc".  This auth method is described in Section 10.1.

   If necessary data is available, the ptypes and properties defined in
   Section 10.2 SHOULD be recorded in an Authentication-Results header
   field:

   o  smtp.remote-ip - The address of the connection-initiating SMTP
      server, from which the message is being relayed.

   o  header.oldest-pass - The instance number of the oldest AMS that
      still validates, or 0 if all pass.

7.  Use Cases

   This section explores several messaging handling use cases that are
   addressed by ARC.

7.1.  Communicate Authentication Assessment Across Trust Boundaries

   When an intermediary ADMD adds an ARC Set to a message's
   Authenticated Received Chain (or creates the initial ARC Set), the
   ADMD communicates its authentication assessment to the next ARC-
   participating ADMD in the message handling path.

   If ARC-enabled ADMDs are trusted, Authenticated Received Chains can
   be used to bridge administrative boundaries.

7.1.1.  Message Scanning Services

   Message services are available to perform anti-spam, anti-malware,
   and anti-phishing scanning.  Such services typically remove malicious
   content, replace HTTP links in messages with sanitized links, and/or
   attach footers to messages advertising the abilities of the message
   scanning service.  These modifications almost always break signature-
   based authentication (such as DKIM).

   Scanning services typically require clients to point MX records of an
   Internet domain to the scanning service.  Messages destined for the
   Internet domain are initially delivered to the scanning service.
   Once scanning is performed, messages are then routed to the client's
   own mail handling infrastructure.  Re-routing messages in this way
   almost always breaks path-based authentication (such as SPF).

   Message scanning services can attach Authenticated Received Chains to
   messages to communicate authentication assessment into client ADMDs.
   Clients can then benefit from the message scanning service while
   processing messages as if the client's infrastructure were the
   original destination of the Internet domain's MX record.

7.1.2.  Multi-tier MTA Processing

   Large message processing infrastructure is often divided into several
   processing tiers that can break authentication information between
   tiers.  For example, a large site may maintain a cluster of MTAs
   dedicated to connection handling and enforcement of IP-based
   reputation filtering.  A secondary cluster of MTAs may be dedicated
   and optimized for content-based processing of messages.

   Authenticated Received Chains can be used to communicate
   authentication assessment between processing tiers.

Internet-Draft                ARC-Protocol                  October 2018


7.1.3.  Mailing Lists

   Mailing lists take delivery of messages and re-post them to
   subscribers.  A full description of authentication-related mailing
   list issues can be found in [RFC7960] Section 3.2.3.

   Mailing list services can implement ARC to convey the authentication
   assessment of posted messages sent to the list's subscriber base.
   The ADMDs of the mailing list subscribers can then use the
   Authenticated Received Chain to determine the authentication
   assessment of the original message before mailing list handling.

7.2.  Inform Message Disposition Decisions

   Intermediaries often break authentication through content
   modification, interfere with path-based authentication (such as SPF),
   and strip authentication results (if an MTA removes Authentication-
   Results header fields).

   Authenticated Received Chains allow ARC Validators to:

   1.  identify ARC-enabled ADMDs that break authentication while
       processing messages;

   2.  gain extended visibility into the authentication-preserving
       abilities of ADMDs that relay messages into ARC-enabled ADMDs.

   Through the collection of ARC-related data, an ADMD can identify
   handling paths that have broken authentication.

   An Authenticated Received Chain allows an Internet Mail Handler to
   potentially base decisions of message disposition on authentication
   assessments provided by different ADMDs.

7.2.1.  DMARC Local Policy Overrides

   DMARC introduces a policy model where Domain Owners can request email
   receivers to reject or quarantine messages that fail DMARC alignment.
   Interoperability issues between DMARC and indirect email flows are
   documented in [RFC7960].

   Authenticated Received Chains allow DMARC processors to consider
   authentication assessments provided by other ADMDs.  As a matter of
   local policy, a DMARC processor MAY choose to accept the
   authentication assessments provided by an Authenticated Received
   Chain when determining if a message is DMARC compliant.

Internet-Draft                ARC-Protocol                  October 2018


   When an Authenticated Received Chain is used to determine message
   disposition, the DMARC processor can communicate this local policy
   decision to Domain Owners as described in Section 7.2.2.

7.2.2.  DMARC Reporting

   DMARC-enabled receivers indicate when ARC Validation influences
   DMARC-related local policy decisions.  When an ARC-enabled handler
   generates a DMARC report, it MAY indicate the influence of ARC on
   their local policy decision(s) by adding a reason of "local_policy"
   with a comment string (per [RFC7489] Appendix C) containing a list of
   data discovered during ARC Validation, which at a minimum includes:

   o  the Chain Validation Status,

   o  the domain and selector for each AS,

   o  the originating IP address from the first ARC Set:

   EXAMPLE:

   <policy_evaluated>
     <disposition>none</disposition>
     <dkim>fail</dkim>
     <spf>fail</spf>

   In the above example DMARC XML reporting fragment, data relating to
   specific validated ARC Sets are enumerated using array syntax (eg,
   "as[2]" means AS header field with instance value of 2). d2.example
   is the Sealing domain for ARC Set #2 (i=2) and d1.example is the
   Sealing domain for ARC Set #1 (i=1).

   Depending on the reporting practices of intermediate message
   handlers, Domain Owners may receive multiple DMARC reports for a
   single message.  Receivers of DMARC reports should be aware of this
   behaviour and make the necessary accommodations.

8.  Privacy Considerations

   The Authenticated Received Chain provides a verifiable record of the
   handlers for a message.  This record may include Personally
   Identifiable Information such as IP address(es) and domain names.
   Such information is also included in existing non-ARC related header
   fields such as the "Received" header fields.

9.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations of [RFC6376] and [I-D-7601bis] apply
   directly to this specification.

   As with other domain authentication technologies (such as SPF, DKIM,
   and DMARC), ARC makes no claims about the semantic content of
   messages.

9.1.  Increased Header Field Size

   Inclusion of Authenticated Received Chains into messages may cause
   issues for older or constrained MTAs due to increased total header
   field size.  Large header field blocks, in general, may cause
   failures to deliver or other outage scenarios for such MTAs.  ARC
   itself would not cause problems.

9.2.  DNS Operations

   The validation of an Authenticated Received Chain composed of N ARC
   Sets can require up to 2*N DNS queries (not including any DNS
   redirection mechanisms which can increase the total number of
   queries).  This leads to two considerations:

   1.  An attacker can send a message to an ARC participant with a
       concocted sequence of ARC Sets bearing the domains of intended
       victims, and all of them will be queried by the participant until
       a failure is discovered.  DNS caching and the difficulty of
       forging the signature values should limit the extent of this load
       to domains under control of the attacker.  Query traffic pattern
       analysis may expose information about downstream validating ADMD
       infrastructure.

   2.  DKIM only performs one DNS query per signature, while ARC can
       introduce many (per chain).  Absent caching, slow DNS responses
       can cause SMTP timeouts; and backlogged delivery queues on
       Validating systems.  This could be exploited as a DoS attack.

Internet-Draft                ARC-Protocol                  October 2018


9.3.  Message Content Suspicion

   Recipients are cautioned to treat messages bearing Authenticated
   Received Chains with the same suspicion applied to all other
   messages.  This includes appropriate content scanning and other
   checks for potentially malicious content.

   ARC authenticates the identity of some email handling actors.  It
   does not make any assessment of their trustworthiness.

   Just as passing message authentication is not an indication of
   message safety, forwarding that information through the mechanism of
   ARC is also not an indication of message safety.  Even if all ARC-
   enabled ADMDs are trusted, ADMDs may have become compromised, may
   miss unsafe content, or may not properly authenticate messages.

9.4.  Message Sealer Suspicion

   Recipients are cautioned to treat every Sealer of the ARC Chain with
   suspicion.  Just as with a validated DKIM signature, responsibility
   for message handling is attributed to the Sealing domain, but whether
   or not that Sealer is a malicious actor is out of scope of the
   authentication mechanism.  Since ARC aids message delivery in the
   event of an authentication failure, ARC Sealers should be treated
   with suspicion, so that a malicious actor cannot Seal spam or other
   fraudulent messages to aid their delivery, too.

9.5.  Replay Attacks

   Since ARC inherits heavily from DKIM, it has similar attack vectors.
   In particular, the Replay Attack described in [RFC6376] section 8.6
   is potentially amplified by ARC's chained statuses.  In an ARC replay
   attack, a malicious actor would take an intact and passing ARC Chain,
   and then resend it to many recipients without making any
   modifications that invalidate the latest AMS or AS.  The impact to a
   receiver would be more DNS lookups and signature evaluations.  This
   scope of this attack can be limited by caching DNS queries and
   following the same signing scope guidance from [RFC6376] section
   5.4.1.

10.  IANA Considerations

   [[ *Note to the RFC Editors:* "dkim - header - s" is defined in
   [I-D-7601bis].  Please adjust the list below as appropriate. ]]

   This draft introduces three new headers fields and updates the Email
   Authentication Parameters registry with one new authentication method
   and several status codes.

11.  Experimental Considerations

   The ARC protocol is designed to address common interoperability
   issues introduced by intermediate message handlers.  Interoperability
   issues are described in [RFC6377] and [RFC7960].

   As the ARC protocol is implemented by Internet Mail Handlers over
   time, the following should be evaluated in order to determine the
   success of the protocol in accomplishing the intended benefits.

11.1.  Success Consideration

   In an attempt to deliver legitimate messages that users desire, many
   receivers use heuristic-based methods to identify messages that
   arrive via indirect delivery paths.




Andersen, et al.          Expires April 5, 2019                [Page 25]

Internet-Draft                ARC-Protocol                  October 2018


   ARC will be a success if the presence of Authenticated Received
   Chains allows for improved decision making when processing legitimate
   messages, specifically resulting in equal or better delivery rates
   than achieve through the use of heuristic approaches.

11.2.  Failure Considerations

   ARC should function without introducing significant new vectors for
   abuse (see Section 9).  If unforeseen vectors are enabled by ARC,
   then this protocol will be a failure.  Note that weaknesses inherent
   in the mail protocols ARC is built upon (such as DKIM replay attacks
   and other known issues) are not new vectors which can be attributed
   to this specification.

11.3.  Open Questions

   The following open questions are academic and have no clear answer at
   the time of the development of the protocol.  However, additional
   deployments should be able to gather the necessary data to answer
   some or all of them.

11.3.1.  Value of the ARC-Seal (AS) Header Field

   Data should be collected to show if the ARC-Seal (AS) provides value
   beyond the ARC Message Signature (AMS) for either making delivery
   decisions or catching malicious actors trying to craft or replay
   malicious chains.

11.3.2.  Usage and/or signals from multiple selectors and/or domains in
         ARC sets

   Any selectors and/or (sub)domains (under the control of the sealing
   ADMD) may be used for ARC header field signatures.

   While implementers may choose to use various selectors and/or domains
   for ARC set header fields, no compelling argument for or against such
   usage has been made within the working group.  As such we have chosen
   to allow maximum freedom for the experimental definition of this
   protocol.

   Wider deployment experience and higher volumes of traffic may show
   whether this is useful.

11.3.3.  DNS Overhead

   Longer Authenticated Received Chains will require more queries to
   retrieve the keys for validating the chain.  While this is not
   believed to be a security issue (see Section 9.2), it is unclear how



Andersen, et al.          Expires April 5, 2019                [Page 26]

Internet-Draft                ARC-Protocol                  October 2018


   much overhead will truly be added.  This is similar to some of the
   initial processing and query load concerns which were debated at the
   time of the DKIM specification development.

   Data should be collected to better understand usable length and
   distribution of lengths found in valid Authenticated Received Chains
   along with the DNS impact of processing Authenticated Received
   Chains.

   An effective operational maximum will have to be developed through
   deployment experience in the field.

11.3.4.  What Trace Information is Valuable

   There are several edge cases where the information in the AAR can
   make the difference between message delivery or rejection.  For
   example, if there is a well known mailing list that seals with ARC
   but doesn't do its own initial DMARC enforcement, an Internet Mail
   Handler with this knowledge could make a delivery decision based upon
   the authentication information it sees in the corresponding AAR
   header field.

   Certain trace information in the AAR is useful/necessary in the
   construction of DMARC reports.

   Further, certain receivers believe the entire set of trace
   information would be valuable to feed into machine learning systems
   to identify fraud and/or provide other signals related to message
   delivery.

   At this point, however, it is unclear what trace information will be
   valuable for all receivers, regardless of size.

   Data should be collected on what trace information receivers are
   using that provides useful signals that affect deliverability, and
   what portions of the trace data are left untouched or provide no
   useful information.

   Since many such systems are intentionally proprietary or confidential
   to prevent gaming by abusers, it may not be viable to reliably answer
   this particular question.  The evolving nature of attacks can also
   shift the landscape of "useful" information over time.

Appendix A.  Appendix A - Design Requirements

   The specification of the ARC framework is driven by the following
   high-level goals, security considerations, and practical operational
   requirements.

A.1.  Primary Design Criteria

   o  Provide a verifiable "chain of custody" for email messages;

   o  Not require changes for originators of email;

   o  Support the verification of the ARC header field set by each hop
      in the handling chain;

   o  Work at Internet scale; and

   o  Provide a trustable mechanism for the communication of
      Authentication-Results across trust boundaries.

A.2.  Out of Scope

   ARC is not a trust framework.  Users of the ARC header fields are
   cautioned against making unsubstantiated conclusions when
   encountering a "broken" ARC sequence.

Appendix B.  Appendix B - Example Usage

   [[ TODO: There have been several small changes to the spec that have
   invalidated all the old examples.  Those old examples have been
   removed to prevent confusion.  New examples will be forthcoming
   shortly (early October, 2018) as existing software comes up to date
   with the spec and can independently generate and validate the
   examples.  Issue 17 [6] ]]

   <removed for now to reduce confusion>

Appendix C.  Acknowledgements
