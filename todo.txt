standardization:

alphabetical tag ordering
only whitespace is inbetween tags - after ;
all lowercase(cv,d,s,a,h) except bh=, b=
no trailing semicolon

no unknown or duplicate tags
no dkim q,x,z,l in ams
always include t=
? c= tag







in signing test suite:
*dont change whitespace in message
but whitespace in AMS & AS doesnt even matter, as the test runner is flexible
HOWEVER:
when generating signatures, we're assuming that ams b= was not generated with whitespace, as this changes the value of as b=


in validation test suite:
in the actual suite, as b= is a function of ams b=
it doesn't matter if we break ams b= in input messages, as long as we change the corresponding as b=
